# backing-track-player

This is a fairly simple audio player intended to be used to play backing tracks (keyboards, backing vocals, samples, etc.) in live performance. The primary feature here is that when a track reaches its end, the player will automatically advance to the next song, and wait for the user to press play. This eliminates the need for live performance "hacks" like one song playlists, etc.
